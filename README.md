##Conclusion

Among the 6 models, XGBoost performed excellently with  (train accuracy of 1 and test accuracy of 0.995)
•	XGBoost model exhibits top-tier performance across all criteria, both as an individual and in ensembles. Also, the ensemble approaches utilising LR, RF, SVM + LASSO, and XGBoost, especially when it comes to AUC performed excellently.
   
•	SVM + LASSO model consistently exhibits good performance, especially in AUC, which is an important metric for class distinction.
